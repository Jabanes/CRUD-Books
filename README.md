# Library Management System
## Overview
This project is a simple web-based library management system built using Flask, SQLite, and Bootstrap. It allows users to manage books, customers, and loans. Administrators can add books, add customers, and manage book loans (loan and return). The application also provides a display of ongoing and past loans.

## Features
### 1. Add a Book
Admins can add new books to the system with details like title, author, year published, genre, and type (e.g., physical or digital).
### 2. Add a Customer
Admins can add new customers to the system with necessary details like name, email, and phone number.
### 3. Loan a Book
Admins can loan books to customers by specifying the book, the customer, and the loan period.
### 4. Return a Book
Customers can return the books they've borrowed, and the system will update the loan status.
### 5. Display Loans
Admins can view the current loans, including which books are out and the due dates for returns.
### 6. Home Page
The home page greets users with a message and displays a carousel of featured books.
